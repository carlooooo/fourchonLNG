          <p>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</p>
          <p>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has the exclusive authority to approve or deny an application for the siting, construction, expansion, or operation of an LNG terminal per the Natural Gas Act. The FERC is the lead federal agency that will determine whether Fourchon LNG will be issued an Order Granting Authority under Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act for the construction an LNG project. The FERC will also monitor all construction and restoration activities to insure that Fourchon LNG complies with all federal, state, and local permits, plans, and regulations. </p>
          <p>The Approval Process</p>
          <p>The initial step in the process was to request from FERC to engage in the Pre-Filing Environmental Review Process. The pre-filing process provides opportunities for federal and state cooperating agencies (LDEQ, USACE, USFWS, etc.), and other public stakeholders to comment on the project impacts prior to an application to the FERC being submitted.</p>
          <p>Permission was granted to begin the pre-filing on August 21st 2017. Fourchon LNG has begun to prepare the draft resource reports. </p>
          <p>The Resource Reports are divided into the following subjects: </p>
          <ul>* General project description
          </br>* Water use and quality
          </br>* Fish, wildlife, and vegetation
          </br>* Cultural resources
          </br>* Socioeconomics
          </br>* Geological resources
          </br>* Soils
          </br>* Land use, recreation, and aesthetics
          </br>* Air and noise quality
          </br>* Alternatives
          </br>* Reliability and safety
          </br>* PCB contamination
          </br>* Engineering and design material
          </ul>
