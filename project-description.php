          <h3 class="my-3">Project Proponent: Fourchon LNG LLC.</h3>
          <h3 class="my-3">Project Description: </h3>
          <p>Fourchon LNG proposes to site, construct, own, and operate a LNG liquefaction facility with a peak capacity of approximately five (5.0) million metric tons of LNG per annum (MTPA) and a ship berth on Belle Pass, Port Fourchon. The project will be developed in phases and the first phase will have a capacity of two (2.0) million MTPA, to be followed by the remaining LNG trains. The Project, which will utilize domestic sources of natural gas, will receive, liquefy, store, and deliver LNG to LNG carriers (LNGCs) for export in overseas markets and domestically to LNG fueled marine vessels.</p>
          <p>The principal Project facilities will include: up to ten (10) LNG trains each with an average base LNG production capacity of approximately 0.5 MTPA; pre-treatment facilities; two (2) LNG storage tanks (88,000 cubic meters (m3) each) and tank protection systems; one marine loading berth capable of receiving up to 180,000 cubic meter LNGCs; on-site electric power generation facilities. A short pipeline connection (totaling approximately 1 mile) to deliver feed gas to the terminal is planned to be designed and constructed by the operator, at Fourchon LNG cost.</p>
          <p>In addition to the general information about the project above, more specific information can be found on the following pages:</p>

                        <p>The main benefits associated with the Project are summarized below.</p>

                        <p>• Direct Job Creation/Employment Sustainability: This benefit is reflected in the need for up to 300 peak construction workers at the Terminal Site for the Phase I of Project over the 29-month construction timeframe and hundreds of off-site workers to support the Project in indirect . A similar peak number may be required for further 24 months during Phase II and in addition dozens of full time employees will be required to operate the Project facilities.</P>

                        <p>• National Security and Foreign Relations: The export of LNG will help improve economic trade and ties between the U.S. and destination countries, which could include nations in Asia and the Caribbean. LNG exports can have widespread geopolitical benefits, among which allowing access for American allies to diverse sources of Energy and reducing European reliance on Russian natural gas supplies.

                        <p>• Economic Benefits: In addition to job creation and employment sustainability, the Project will generate substantial tax revenues and improve the United States’ balance of trade. The economic benefits associated with the Facility would continue for the life of the operation, bringing stable, long-term economic value to the State of Louisiana and specifically Lafourche Parish and the surrounding area.</p>

                        <p>• Environmental Benefits: Importation of LNG by foreign countries and its availability as fuel for power generation and transportation will permit the displacement of existing and future coal, heavy fuel oil and diesel power generation, and displacement of heavy fuel oil, diesel, and gasoline for vehicles and marine engines, thereby reducing global greenhouse gas, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, particulates, and other environmentally harmful emissions. DOE has found that, in most scenarios, power generation from imported natural gas results in lower greenhouse gas emission than coal, including an almost 40 percent reduction over a 100-year life cycle. </p>
